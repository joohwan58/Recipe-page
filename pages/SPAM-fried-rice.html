        <h1>SPAM fried rice!</h1>
        <p>Fried rice has a false perception of requiring lots of skill to get right. This is true if you want a top class meal to impress others, but if you just want something edible to get by as a broke college student, it takes no skill at all.</p>
        <p>You will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Leftover rice</li>
            <li>SPAM</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>cooking oil</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Depending on how much risce you have, the portions of the other ingredients will change. For example, one full bowl of rice needs around 2 eggs and 1 whole onion.</p>
        <p>First, we will prepare the ingredients. Chop the SPAM and the onions into bite-sized pieces. Then, crack the eggs open in a small bowl, and half scramble them.</p>
        <p>Get the biggest frying pan you have. Things will be moving fast now, so gather the rest of the ingrenients in an easy to reach spot.</p>
        <p>First, pan fry the SPAM to your slightly less than your preferred level of crispiness. Set it aside in another bowl.</p>
        <p>Then, add a bit of oil to your pan, and fry your onions, once again to slightly less than your preferred level of browning. Set it aside in the same bowl you put the SPAM in.</p>
        <p>Now add the rice into the pan. Gently pat the rice flat onto the pan and let it get crispy. This takes about 3-4 minutes.</p>
        <p>Once the rice is crisped to your preferred level, its time for the main show. Add the eggs you scrambles, and the SPAM and onions you put aside, and start mixing like your life depends on it. Add some soy sauce for seasoning while you are mixing.</p>
        <p>And there you go! While mixing, it should start to look more and more like the picture above. Once it looks ready, you can enjoy.</p>
        <h2>Why this is great for broke college students</h2>
        <p>The great thing about this recipe is that it is infinitely customisable. The only absolutely necessary ingrenients are rice, SPAM, and eggs. I gave onions as an example of a additional ingredient you could use, but anything and everything could be added to this recipe.</p>
        <p>Other than onions, you could also add green beans, garlic, carrots, lettuce, canned tuna... Simply pre-cook them just like the onions and add them in the mixing step. Look inside your fridge for inspiration on extending this recipe!</p>
        <p>Even the seasoning isn't absolutely necessary. You could use sesame oil, oyster sauce, just salt, or you could simply go without seasoning. You could even use leftover Mcdonalds ketchup to go with your fried rice. Just use whatever you have on hand.</p>
        <p>This is the great thing about this recipe. You dont need super specific ingredients. Leftovers, spare ingredients from your other cooking misadventures... anything could be added to this dish.</p>
        <p>I hope this recipe helps you survive college. I support the broke college students of the world.</p>
