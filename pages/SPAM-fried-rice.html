        <h1>SPAM fried rice!</h1>
        <p>Fried rice has a false perception of requiring lots of skill to get right. This is true if you want a top class meal to impress others, but if you just want something edible to get by as a broke college student, it takes no skill at all.</p>
        <p>You will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>leftover rice</li>
            <li>SPAM</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>cokking oil</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
        </ul>
